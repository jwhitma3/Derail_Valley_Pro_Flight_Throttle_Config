# Derail_Valley_Pro_Flight_Throttle_Config
Locate your Derail Valley config file located in ~\AppData\LocalLow\Altfuture\Derail Valley\Preferences\[000_Steam_Name.ini].
Optional: Make a backup copy of the existing .ini file (you can recreate the default condiguration later from within Derail Valley if you don't want to save a backup now)
Open the existing .ini file in a text edditor (Notepad++, Notepad, etc). Do the same for the new .ini file. Copy only the section labeled \[Non-VR_KeyBindings\] (lines 1 to 113). Replace the same lines in the existing .ini file with these modified settings.

Open JoyToKey and import the Joystick configuration file \[Derail_Valley_Joy_To_Key_Config_for_Pro_Flight_Throttle.cfg\] into a new JoyToKey profile.

JoyToKey ONLY handles the button presses. You must download and install dvDirectInput from https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/687 to use the throttles in game.
